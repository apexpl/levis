# Levis - Lightweight PHP Framework

Small, lightweight PHP framework allowing you to quickly and efficiently develop your operations.  

If you find Levis to be too lightweight or missing desired functionality, please take a look at Apex at https://apexpl.io/ which is a larger and more feature rich version.

## Installation

Install via composer with:

> `composer create-project apex/levis`

Start HTTP server with the commands:

~~~bash
cd levis/public
php -S 127.0.0.1:80 index.php
~~~

You may now open http://127.0.0.1/ to view the Levis home page in your browser.


#### Docker

Otherwise, install via Docker with:

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/apexpl/levis
cd levis
docker-compose up -d
~~~

Upon successfl installation via Docker, the site will be available at http://127.0.0.1/.
