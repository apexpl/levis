# Quick Start

This page will very briefly run you through Levis.  Please refer to the [full documentation](https://github.com/apexpl/levis/) for more detailed information.

## Installation

Install with the command:

> `composer create-project apex/levis`

Start HTTP server with the commands:

~~~bash
cd levis/public
php -S 127.0.0.1:8080 index.php
~~~

You may now open http://127.0.0.1:8080/ to view the Levis home page in your browser.


## Create View

Create a file at ~/views/html/test.html with any body contents you would like, for example:

~~~
<h1>Test Page</h1>

<p>Just testing this whole Levis thing.</p>
~~~

By default Levis has auto-routing enabled and since the page is named test.html, open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8080/test to view its contents.
